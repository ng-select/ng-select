	Most common case is showing data from backend API and with ng-select this is extremely simple since you can bind directly to observable
	when using angular <b> | async</b> pipe

<ng-select [items]="people$ | async" bindLabel="name" autofocus bindValue="id" [(ngModel)]="selectedPersonId"> </ng-select>

<br />Selected: {{ selectedPersonId }}
