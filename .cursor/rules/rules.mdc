# Cursor Rules for Angular Projects

## Always Applied Rules

### 1. Use Latest Angular and TypeScript
- Always use the latest stable Angular (currently v21) and TypeScript
- Reference Angular 21 APIs and features only
- Do not use deprecated or removed APIs from older versions

### 2. Modern Angular Features
- Prefer Angular control flow syntax (`@for`, `@if`, `@switch`) over legacy structural directives (`*ngFor`, `*ngIf`, `*ngSwitch`)
- Use Angular signals for state management and reactivity
- Use input and output signals for component communication, not legacy decorators
- Example: `input()`, `output()`, `signal()`, `computed()`, `effect()`

### 3. No Legacy Decorators
- Do not use or recommend `@Input` and `@Output` decorators in new code
- Use signals and the latest Angular data flow/event patterns
- Replace `@Input()` with `input()` and `@Output()` with `output()`

### 4. Template Syntax & Style
- Use the latest template syntax and best practices
- Use `<ng-container>` for structural grouping when needed
- Prefer control flow over structural directives
- Use proper Angular template binding syntax

### 5. Component Architecture
- Prefer standalone components; avoid NgModules for new features unless necessary
- Encapsulate features in self-contained, reusable components
- Use `standalone: true` in component decorators
- Import dependencies directly in components rather than through modules

### 6. Type Safety & Strictness
- Ensure `"strict": true` in all `tsconfig.json` files
- Always provide explicit types for functions, variables, and observables
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all Angular constructs
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### 7. Dependency Injection
- Use `@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})` for services unless a different scope is required
- Prefer Angular DI patterns over manual instantiation or singletons
- Use proper injection tokens for configuration

### 8. API Communication
- Use Angular's `HttpClient` for all HTTP/API interactions
- Prefer typed HTTP responses and RxJS-based error handling
- Use proper error handling with RxJS operators
- Implement proper loading states and error states

### 9. State Management
- Use signals for component-level and global state
- Avoid heavy/legacy state libraries like NgRx
- Prefer reactive patterns with signals over imperative state management

### 10. Testing
- Include unit test snippets for all code examples where applicable
- Use Angular's karma and jasmine testing APIs
- Test components, services, and utilities thoroughly
- Use proper mocking and testing utilities

### 11. Accessibility
- Ensure all code follows WCAG guidelines and Angular accessibility best practices
- Use proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Test with accessibility tools

### 12. Documentation and Comments
- Comment public APIs, inputs, and outputs
- Follow Angular style guide for structure and naming
- Use JSDoc comments for complex functions and services
- Document component inputs, outputs, and lifecycle hooks

### 13. No Deprecated APIs
- Do not use or recommend deprecated Angular APIs, patterns, or features
- Check for breaking changes or removals for each new Angular version
- Stay updated with Angular release notes and migration guides

### 14. Package Manager
 - Always use yarn in this project

## Code Generation Rules

When generating Angular code:
- Always use the latest Angular syntax and patterns
- Include proper TypeScript typing
- Use signals for state management
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow Angular style guide conventions
- Include accessibility considerations
- Provide unit test examples where appropriate
