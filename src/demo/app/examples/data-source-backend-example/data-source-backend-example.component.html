    Most common case is showing data from backend
    API and with ng-select this is extremely simple since you can bind directly to
    observable when using angular <b> | async</b> pipe
</p>

<ng-select [items]="people$ | async"
           bindLabel="name"
           autofocus
           bindValue="id"
           [(ngModel)]="selectedPersonId">
</ng-select>

<br/>Selected: {{selectedPersonId}}
